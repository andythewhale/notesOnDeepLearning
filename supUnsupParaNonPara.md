This will be a short little intro because I already wrote down most of this garbage in my notebook. The takeaway for my reading subject today was that deep learning is a parametric ... thing. Neural networks perform both supervised and unsupervised machine learning. Remember when it's unsupervised we are just classifying shit so we can used supervised learning or reinforcement learning and re-evaluate everything. And we do all of this parametrically. Meaning that we have a finite amount of parameters. So we use our parametric data sets, even when we don't have enough information on them. We then use a combination of PCA and classification to create meaningful classifiers and eliminate meaningless parameters. Amazing!
