A prediction is the processing of data. Each data point is hit with a transformation one at a time. Even if this transformation is just adding a dimension. Yo can also do mutliple data points at once. Which is what machiine earning is all about now. This is why GPU usage is on the rise in machine learning... Because they process all these points at once and look for patterns inthe data. But it's also good to think of processing as one data point at a time while at the same time processing the parameters of other data points. A Neural network can just be seen as the performance of a function. Like when I take A and multiply it by B to get C etc. If you do this over a vector you're performing the action of a neuron. A neuron just processes or transforms data. Input data is something that is easily knowable. A prediction is a transformation of this data. Whether the prediction is right or wrong doesn't really matter. Our goal is for our network to learn and to adjust its transformation paramaters such that they move closer to the correct answer. So we can give our neural network more than just one data point at a time. When you have mutltiple input and you're looking for one answer they have to converge somewhere. The convergence is done by taking the peices of data and combining them into one piece of data.
