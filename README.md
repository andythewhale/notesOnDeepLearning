# notesOnDeepLearning
Markdown notes on deep learning literatures and other stuff. I don't know. This stuff is for me, it won't make sense to anyone else. At best this will be evidence that I actually read something and took notes on it. But I will not specify sources for each entry. I will however post links to material that you can pay for or to support the actual authors of the texts that I'm reading.


Thank you!
Andy
